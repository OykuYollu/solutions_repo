# Problem 1: Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations

## üåü Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics. It states that, regardless of the population's original distribution, the sampling distribution of the **sample mean** will approximate a **normal distribution** as the **sample size increases**.

This simulation explores the CLT using Python to demonstrate how the shape of the original distribution and the sample size affect convergence to normality.

## üß™ 1. Simulating Sampling Distributions

We will generate data from three different population distributions:

* `Uniform distribution`
* `Exponential distribution`
* `Binomial distribution`

Each population will contain **100,000 random values** to ensure a large base for sampling.

---

## üìä 2. Sampling and Visualization

We'll sample from each population using different sample sizes:

* Sample sizes: `[5, 10, 30, 50]`
* For each size, we'll draw **10,000 samples**
* For each sample, compute the **mean**
* Then, plot the **histogram of the sample means**

Libraries to use:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from google.colab import files  # for download in Colab
```

---

## üîç 3. Parameter Exploration

We'll analyze:

* How skewness and kurtosis of the population distribution affect the speed of convergence.
* How variance influences the spread of the sampling distribution.

---

## üî† 4. Practical Applications

The CLT is essential in real-world contexts such as:

* **Polling**: Estimating population opinion from small samples.
* **Manufacturing**: Quality control through average defect rates.
* **Finance**: Modeling aggregated risk under normality assumptions.

## üìà Interpretation & Discussion

### ‚ûî Observations:

* `Uniform`: Even small samples (n=10) show near-normality due to symmetry.
* `Exponential`: Requires larger n (‚â• 30) for normal approximation due to skewness.
* `Binomial`: Discrete but bounded, converges well for moderate n.

### ‚ûî Variance Impact:

* Higher original variance ‚Üí wider sampling distribution.
* As n increases, spread decreases ~ 1/‚àön.

### ‚ûî Convergence Insight:

This simulation visually confirms the CLT: regardless of original distribution, the sampling mean distribution becomes approximately normal with sufficient sample size.

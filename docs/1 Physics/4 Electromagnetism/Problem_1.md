# Problem 1: Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

## Motivation

The Lorentz force, expressed as **F = qE + q(v Ã— B)**, governs the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. It plays a central role in plasma physics, mass spectrometry, particle accelerators, and astrophysics. Through simulation, we can visualize particle dynamics and build intuition about how they behave in various field configurations.

## Lorentz Force Simulation: Circular Motion

### Introduction

In a **uniform magnetic field** with **no electric field**, the Lorentz force reduces to:

**F = q (v Ã— B)**

This results in **circular motion** in the x-y plane as the force is always perpendicular to the velocity.

### Parameters

* Charge (q): 1 C
* Mass (m): 0.001 kg
* Magnetic Field (B): \[0, 0, 1] T
* Initial Velocity: \[1, 0, 0] m/s

### Output

## Lorentz Force Simulation: Helical (Spiral) Motion

### Introduction

Adding a **z-component** to the initial velocity causes the particle to move forward while rotating, forming a **helical (spiral) trajectory**.

### Parameters

* Charge (q): 1 C
* Mass (m): 0.001 kg
* Magnetic Field (B): \[0, 0, 1] T
* Initial Velocity: \[1, 0, 0.5] m/s

### Output

## Lorentz Force Simulation: Drift Motion (E Ã— B)

### Introduction

With a **perpendicular electric field**, the particle undergoes circular motion but also drifts in a straight direction, forming an **E Ã— B drift**.

### Parameters

* Electric Field (E): \[1, 0, 0] V/m
* Magnetic Field (B): \[0, 0, 1] T
* Charge (q): 1 C
* Mass (m): 0.001 kg
* Initial Velocity: \[0, 1, 0] m/s

### Output

## Complex 3D Trajectory (Inclined Fields with Boris Algorithm)

### Description

This simulation uses the **Boris algorithm** to compute the motion of a charged particle under:

* A uniform electric field in the z-direction
* An inclined magnetic field with components in both x and z

This results in a **complex drift trajectory** due to the E Ã— B interaction.

### Parameters

* Charge (q): 1 C
* Mass (m): 0.001 kg
* Electric Field (E): \[0, 0, 1000] V/m
* Magnetic Field (B): \[0.1, 0, 1] T
* Initial Velocity: \[1e5, 0, 0] m/s

### Output

*Figure: 3D trajectory with electric and inclined magnetic fields.*

## Summary & Notes

* **Circular motion** results from a velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field.
* **Helical motion** arises when the velocity also has a component along the magnetic field.
* **E Ã— B drift** appears when the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular.
* The **Boris algorithm** provides stable motion simulation under combined fields.
* All simulations use classical (non-relativistic) physics.

## ðŸ§© Conclusion

The Lorentz force simulations demonstrate key aspects of particle motion in electromagnetic fields. Through different initial conditions and field setups, we observed:

* Circular trajectories in pure magnetic fields
